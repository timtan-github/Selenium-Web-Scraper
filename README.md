# Selenium-Web-Scraper
This Selenium web scraper was used in the data collection phase of a larger project to analyze writer and reader profiles of Medium Publications. 

The project is largely a topic analysis utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) together with Grid-search to find the top topics writers are publishing.
